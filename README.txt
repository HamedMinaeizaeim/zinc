README: OpenCMISS-Zinc Library

The OpenCMISS-Zinc library (Zinc) provides a complete API for creating software to interact with and visualise complex finite element models and image-based fields.  The strengths of the library are in field storage, including many finite element basis types, a mathematical field abstraction layer including image processing, and high quality 3D visualisation using OpenGL.

This software was originally developed at The University of Auckland and Copyright is held by Auckland UniServices Ltd. and other contributors.  See file COPYRIGHT.txt in the same folder.

Zinc is released under the Mozilla Public License v2.0. See file LICENSE.txt in the same folder.

Zinc is currently built and tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  Developer and release binaries are available for download.
